Well, it's October now, I guess. Each new month begins with promise and another empty page. I get to {{{mark(choose how to fill the pages)}}}. Recently, it feels like too many of them remain empty. I need to fix that.

The {{{mark(Paper vs Digital debate)}}} continues apace. One nice thing about notes on paper is that I'm not tempted, nor do I feel obligated, to share them. On the other hand, what if I /do/ want to share them?

I'm having second thoughts about writing my daily posts over on [[https://baty.net][baty.net]]. They don't belong in the RSS feed. Or at least I don't like them there. So, I thought I'd go back to putting them on [[https://rudimentarylathe.org][the wiki]], but I'm not sure why. Maybe because it's so easy to post there. Perhaps they belong here. After all, it's called "Jack Baty Daily" right? Let's see how it feels.

But here is the strangest, and possibly the saddest, thing about my long and so far unsuccessful attempts to keep a diary: although I can say with complete certainty that I have never disposed of a notebook, as I write this today, on August 27, 2022, with my current, slightly torn black notebook on the table beside me, I have absolutely no idea where its predecessors have got to, nor what they contained, and when I turn my mind to this, as I repeatedly do, the feeling of loss is immeasurable.

My wife and I strolled around the lakefront in Saugatuck yesterday. I took only the M10-R with 35mm Summilux. There were people, dogs, boats, and water everywhere. {{{mark(I took fewer than 20 photos and maybe 2 don't suck)}}}. I'm not sure why I bother. And I'm especially unsure why I bother with an expensive digital rangefinder. What's worse, is that I'm having a difficult time focusing the rangefinder. So, with some regret, I've [[https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1762243][relisted the M10-R for sale]].

I've used many {{{mark(film emulation "presets")}}} over the years. Since I've recently been testing DxO PhotoLab I thought I'd also test their set of presets: [[https://www.dxo.com/dxo-filmpack/][DxO FilmPack - Magic of analog in the age of digital]]. As with most presets, they do a nice job of helping digital photos pretend to be film photos. The fatal flaw with all of these, of course, is that they are /not/ film photos. And that's why I can never get comfortable using them.

The "Notch" is a minor nuisance and certainly not a hill I'd choose to die on. [[http://morrick.me/archives/9621][The notch is wrong | Riccardo Mori]].

Here's the moral of this story: always photograph with the camera that's going to give you the raw material you want to have in case you get a great shot. Even if it's a pain to carry or a pain to use. Because if you photograph regularly, you will get a great shot once in a while. Even if you're not trying. And you need to be ready for that.

I really don't like dealing with WordPress. I copied all recent content from this blog and the baty.net WordPress installation and am hovering over the button to switch DNS for baty.net to the Hugo instance. Wait for it....! *Update* I changed my mind. {{{mark(Still on WordPress)}}}. This may come back, though. I bailed because after copying recent content over and looking through it, I didn't like how certain images were handled and for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to change it.  And then when proofreading, I noticed that paragraphs of text were too hard to read. It's a font or some other typography issue, but I didn't like it.  It also made me think that my theme is just a little too busy, somehow. Hugo theme changes are non-trivial and can be day-long nightmares. So, I bailed. For now.

I ordered a bunch of {{{mark(paraphernalia around keeping index cards)}}}. I mean, I already /have/ a lot of it, but I ordered more: storage boxes, dividers, more cards, etc. This almost guarantees that I won't be using index cards in the future.

I've been testing [[https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/][DxO PhotoLab 5]] and it's quite good. I used to love using "U-Point Technology" years ago in the old Nikon Capture NX app and it's fun to see how far it's come. But it's not U-Point or "Smart Lighting" that draws me to it. It's the lens profiles and the completely amazing DeepPRIME noise reduction. It's like having at least two additional stops available. I may end up buying [[https://www.dxo.com/dxo-pureraw/][DxO PureRAW]] so I can have just the good bits of PhotoLab as a plugin.

TheBrain's "Plex" is created entirely from deliberate linking. It's not a cool-but-nearly-useless explosion of linked notes (see Obsidian). But, it's an app and not a nice, safe, comfortable folder full of plain text files.

Writing here feels like I'm {{{mark(standing on my porch quietly handing out pamphlets)}}}. This is better than social media which is more like me walking down the street yelling at everyone.

In what will come as no surprise to anyone, I am considering {{{mark(moving daily notes back here to daily.baty.net)}}}. Why? Fair question. This time it's because I'm starting to feel like the theme at [[https://baty.net][baty.net]] has become a bit convoluted and therefore fragile due to trying so hard to integrate daily posts with "regular" posts. I get bored and may want to switch up my theme. This would be too much work with the current integrated theme. I'm uncomfortable having to /depend/ on everything being integrated. What if I stopped posting daily notes altogether. That would take some effort to change or it would look stupid. On the other hand, maybe I should just wait and see if any of those what-ifs pan out.

Denote is a simple note-taking tool. It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme.

Yesterday, I {{{mark(posted on every site I have)}}}, just to remind myself what was what. Every site except this one, that is. See, this site is sort of hardwired at this point to require Emacs and Org mode for easy posting. There are times that I try to quit using Emacs for some reason. When that happens I stop posting my daily notes here and move to the wiki or Roam or wherever. Then, after a week or a month, I come to my senses and get back into Emacs. Of course then I want to do /everything/ in Emacs and here we are.

The damn {{{mark(iPad ruins everything)}}}. For example, I finally got [[https://espanso.org][Espanso]] all configured and working perfectly for text expansion on my Mac. Espanso is powerful and free and runs on Mac and Linux (just in case). But of course it doesn't work on iOS, so I had to restart my [[https://textexpander.com][TextExpander]] subscription and change everything to accomodate the iPad. I'm a little pissed about this, but while re-subscribing I found that I have a "lifetime" discount subscription which only ends up costing me around $1.50/month. TextExpander is good and super easy to use so I'm going to be fine.

I am considering some form of {{{mark(internet hiatus)}}}. Social media, mainly. We all suspect it's not healthy, but I'm still addicted and feel like a break would do me good. Can I manage to only post on the blogs and only read my (fairly limited) set of RSS feeds? Is that enough?

How many of the super-cool things I can do with Org mode are actually useful and not just super-cool things that I think are super-cool?

So, I replaced [[https://baty.net][baty.net]] with a {{{mark(Hugo-based version)}}} of the blog. All the content from the WordPress site has been migrated. Well, /most/ of it. Some formatting got all blowed up. This is why I swore I'd never do it again, but here we are. I just got tired of pushing up against all the /stuff/ that is WordPress. *(18 hours later)* . I just switched DNS back and forth twice today. I honestly don't know which site I want to use.

I'm feeling the {{{mark(weight of WordPress)}}} pushing against the inconvenience of maintaining a static blog. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience. So, I've rebuilt all of baty.net using Hugo. Content has been imported and it's ready to go. All I need to do is sync it up to a virtual host on my VPS and update the DNS. But, I'm going to sit on this a bit to see how I feel. I'd hate for it to just have been my mood this morning.

I've been publishing a few of the notes from my Org-roam database over at [[https://notes.baty.net][notes.baty.net]] just in case they might be useful to someone somewhere. I also like to browse them as decent-looking (read-only) HTML files instead of from within Emacs all the time. I'm using a version of the same "CodeIt" theme I used to use for baty.net. Ideally I'd list the categories on the home page rather than a list of recent posts, but Hugo's templating system is completely unfathomable to me so I'm leaving it alone for now. Another thing I'm doing "wrong" is putting the theme's git repo right in the themes folder. No submodules, no hugo modules. I'm just editing in place. Hell, I might just stop keeping it as a separate repo :).

After I don't even know how many years, I've {{{mark(canceled my Dropbox account)}}}

All of our smoke detectors started chirping at the same time last night. No smoke or fire. After an hour of walking around with that ear-piercing shrill, we noticed water coming out of one of the detectors in the basement. The one directly below the kitchen sink. {{{mark(Leaky garbage disposal)}}}. I removed the detector, which had shorted out (causing the ruckus). Turned off the water supply to the sink, and went to bed. Today is garbage disposal replacement day.

The conflict for me happens when I can't decide if it matters to me {{{mark(how things are done)}}}. For example, film photographs mean more to me than digital photographs, so I tend to prefer using film because of /how/ the photos are made. Otherwise, digital gets the job done and is 1,000% easier. Similarly, using Emacs for notes and tasks and blogging is, for me, the correct way to handle things. Plain text, consistent environment, free and open source. On the other hand, using Things and DEVONthink and WordPress sure is pretty and easy.

I {{{mark(updated this site's RSS feed)}}} to only include type "post". By default everything is included and this meant things like the About page were in the RSS feed.

I used to love programming and computers because I could make them /do/ things. I still probably could, but I no longer know what I want them to do.

My tendency to write daily posts {{{mark(here vs the wiki)}}} is tied to how deep I am into Emacs at the moment. Right now... that's /very deep/.


I've spent hours configuring my [[https://www.orgroam.com][Org-roam]] setup so I can {{{mark(publish certain notes as a website)}}}. It's so cool, but in the end I'm not sure it offers clear advantages over the wiki other than that I can make some of my roam notes public without needing to rewrite them in TiddlyWiki. WIP is here: notes.baty.net. *Later*: now I've realized that I can simply add some [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] metadata to any of my Org files and have them publish to this daily notes blog.

Writing in Emacs is great. Static websites are great. Using Emacs to manage and deal with content for a static website exhausts me eventually. Doesn't bode well for this site, although it's probably just my mood today.

I follow [[https://flickr.com/photos/32681588@N03/][Matt Osbourne]] (aka Mr. Leica) on Flickr because he plays with just about every combination of lens and camera you could think of.

You can see below that I'm experimenting with {{{mark(subheadings within daily posts)}}}. This is for things that are more than one paragraph of text or text and images.

"Book of Boba Fett" is terrible. He should've been left as a cool, mysterious background character.

It seems I've settled on [[https://wiki.baty.net][wiki.baty.net]] as the wiki domain. "rl.baty.net" still works, but is discouraged.

Derek Sivers says [[https://sive.rs/plaintext][Write plain text files]] and I mostly agree with him. Except if the plain text format makes what you're actually doing more difficult, then don't. I'd rather have a {{{mark(useful document now)}}} even if there's a chance that one day, maybe, possibly, it could become unreadable. Future-proof-but-shitty is not my first choice.

I've modified things so that the home page {{{mark(shows the past 30 days)}}} rather than 7. Since there's no search here yet, I figure CMD-f will let you search the past month. If it's older than that, it's probably no longer valid anyway üòÜ.

I've {{{mark(removed Disqus comments)}}} from this site. No reason other than it's overhead I don't need and I rarely see any comments anyway. Whatzamatta with you people?! Send me an email or something, sheesh.

It occurs to me that {{{mark(we didn't name web1 and web2 ahead of time)}}}. We just labeled them that later. Now we're inventing web3 and trying to make everything into that. It's a bad idea from the start.

Speaking of Web3, there's now [[https://blogchain.app/home][Blogchain.app]]. I read [[https://blogchain.app/post/bafyreig4eykbszu3czz7crfcqm5saavgqhoaqrgqhsoh5qjeqhz5xg7rc4][How Blogchain is different by capsule on Blogchain]] and I don't see how it's meaningfully better or solves actual problems in any unique way. It's what, WordPress with backups and a social element? Big whoop.

Hooboy, it's March.

Looking at the server analytics (I use [[https://goaccess.io/][GoAccess - Visual Web Log Analyzer]]) for this site shows that a large majority of "hits" are to the RSS feed. This makes me feel a little bad about posting so much over on [[https://wiki.baty.net][the wiki]]. I know I keep saying that my daily notes are "for me" but that guilt I feel makes me think otherwise.

Oh cool, I posted on [[https://jackbaty.tumblr.com][my Tumblr]] this morning.

I put a roll through the IIIC. It was fun. It's a nice lens.

I'd like to do some side-by-side (condensor vs diffusor head) comparisons. And then eventually figure out the problem with the longer lens so I can also make prints from the Hasselblad (6x6) negatives.

You may have noticed that I've been posting daily notes both here and on [[https://rudimentarylathe.wiki][the wiki]]. This is because I like writing in both places and I can't find a path to choosing one of them. The wiki is just so easy and I like that it's right next to most of my other notes. When I don't write here regularly, the rest of the information languishes. It loses its "wikiness". On the other hand, with baty.blog I get to write in Emacs using Org-mode and publish a good-looking "normal" blog with RSS feeds and archives and all the other things that I love about blogs. I think that TiddlyWiki is the best long-term answer, but Hugo is what I prefer living with today. Still noodlin' on it. You may also have noticed that I've cross-posted this in both places. Sigh.

I plugged in the Mac yesterday so I could actually enjoy working with photos. What I'm finding is that I, again, miss using i3 and workspaces the way they're set up in Regolith. I've been trying some combinations of Rectangle and Divvy and Better Touch Tool to see what I can get, but nothing works as smoothly and consistently. I'm about to plug in the ThinkPad for the day. Weird.

OK, there. Back on Linux. It feels good, but at the same time, feels janky. Linux /thinks/ right, but the implementation is often spotty. So help me if I can't figure out how to consistently copy and paste between Emacs, a terminal, and the rest of the system, I'll throw the whole thing out a window.

Nice article about one person's journey into Leica. Lovely photos accompanying the article, too: [[https://fcracer.com/leica-journey-unexpected-and-educational/][Leica Journey: Unexpected and Educational | fcracer]]

I've been tinkering with ideas for my next career, and re-learning Ruby on Rails was on the short list.

I've long admired [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson][DHH]] and [[https://rubyonrails.org][Rails]] and Basecamp (the [[https://basecamp.com/about][company]] and the [[https://basecamp.com/][product]]). I shipped my first Rails app in 2007. I envied the way they ran the company and how open they were about it. I lapped up all their books. I even agreed with the way they handled the whole "no political discussions" fiasco. I used to feel like he, although cocky and arrogant, was right more than he was wrong about most things.

But after reading [[https://world.hey.com/dhh][DHH's newsletter]] lately, I think I'm out.

His latest, [[https://world.hey.com/dhh/spotify-must-be-afraid-of-canceling-rogan-right-right-8fc9f1f6][Spotify must be afraid of canceling Rogan, right? Right?!]], was the final straw for me. It wasn't just the inane title, but that he keeps showing that he doesn't understand the argument and insisting that "both-sides"-ism is always OK.

Neal Young doesn't want to share a platform with Rogan. Not because Rogan "hosts guests with divergent views" because he hosts guests with demonstrably incorrect and dangerous views...and seems to agree with them. DHH apparently doesn't understand science, either. Not really.

Anyway, I don't want to argue with him. And I don't want to argue /about/ him. But, he makes me want to /not/ use his products. Which is a shame because I think Rails is still a valid, viable, and valuable option. I just wanted to vent a little about my disappointment with someone who used to inspire me.

Maybe he'll calm down and get over this latest mood, or at least stop writing so much while feeling the way he seems to feel. I hope so.

Got new eyeglasses yesterday. The prescription changed a bit from my previous pair. They work great, but I feel a little woozy while getting used to them.

#+attr_html: :class imgRightMargin
[[/img/small/linux.png]]

There is a nicely-configured [[https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira][Thelio Mira]] in my shopping cart. I came close to pulling the trigger yesterday, but a clear head prevailed. So far. I know me. In 2 weeks I'll be back on my Mac and the old ThinkPad I'm typing this on will be packed up and in the closet until next time I get the Linux itch. My thinking with the Thelio is that in order to get the full Linux experience, I should work on a faster, modern machine. There could be something to that, but mostly it's just an excuse to buy a new toy. I'm going to sit on it for a month or two and if I still think I could switch to Linux, I'll buy something nice to run it on.

Suddenly, Emacs is running slowly on the ThinkPad. Could it be that I need a faster machine?

It's hard to virtue signal while using a paper notebook. (But /mentioning/ using paper notebooks works great.)

If I could make just one photo like this one by Vivian Maier, I'd be happy:

After a morning of watching videos on [[https://www.darktable.org][Darktable]] I learn that it supports neither the SL2-S or the Q2 Monochrom. Too bad, because it's not as terrible as I remember. Rawtherapee works better, but I kind of hate using it. I'm back to feeling like iOS and macOS are the only options for seriously editing my photos.

Good morning!

[[/img/2022/20220126-L1010053.jpg]]

I've decided to {{{mark(work on my Mac today)}}}, after a few days on Linux. Apple people tend to complain a lot about the sorry state of macOS, but coming back after time away is a stark reminder of the sheer level of refinement in macOS. It's just...nice.

The [[https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira][Thelio Mira]] from System76 is tempting. I'd like to try a modern, powerful desktop machine running Linux. I mean, how else can I do a fair comparison with my MBP? üòú. So far I've avoided the temptation, because, I just bought a top-spec'd MacBook Pro, remember? If it weren't for wanting to edit photos with good software, I'd be much more tempted.

Living down a rabbit hole of photo editing processes, techniques, and software does nothing to improve my photography, so I'm backing off a bit and putting everything in {{{mark(baby Lightroom)}}} for a while.

I've changed tagging for financially-related items in my {{{mark(Org daybook)}}} to ":money:" because I'm tired of trying to decide/remember between :finances:, :finance:, and :financial:. Now it's just :money:

Just for fun, and as a fallback for 1Password, I've started using [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][Pass: The Standard Unix Password Manager]] again. It's been years. I started with a fresh .password-store/ and will fill it as needed.

I've been experimenting with adding highlights to text in my daily posts. The idea is that it makes scanning easier. I pick out the important parts of each entry and add a =<mark>= HTML tag. Then I style the region like so:

#+begin_src css
mark {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3);
}
#+end_src

Recently, there's been a {{{mark(change in org that broke my markup)}}} when exporting from ox-hugo. Here's the comment by [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi][kaushalmodi]]:

[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/540][Issue #540]]
#+begin_quote
This was a recent breaking change that fixed an inconsistency in ox-hugo (compared to ox-html). If we want to export verbatim HTML, it needs to be in @@html:..@@ or in an HTML export block
#+end_quote

His suggestion to use a macro was excellent, so I did that. At the top of my posts.org file, is this:

=#+macro: mark @@html:<mark>$1</mark>@@=

When I want to =<mark>= some text, I add the macro inline, like so:

=I would like to {{{mark(mark this text)}}} so that it is highlighted=

But who has time to add all that markup by hand? To make it easier, I created the following function:

#+begin_src lisp
(defun jab/markregion ()
  "Add a 'mark' macro to the current region (for Hugo)"
  (interactive)
  (if (region-active-p)
      (progn
        (goto-char (region-end))
        (insert ")}}}")
        (goto-char (region-beginning))
        (insert "{{{mark("))))
#+end_src

Now, I select a region and run =M-x jab/markregion=. I may create a keybinding for it, too, but for now this is fast and easy.

I moved a lot of my synced files on the Mac {{{mark(out of iCloud Files)}}}.
This was mainly due to wanting them available on Linux, but also because iCloud

I'm thinking I'll reserve using [[https://jack.micro.blog][my micro.blog]] for posting images. Mostly.

I moved a lot of my synced files on the Mac {{{mark(out of iCloud Files)}}}.
This was mainly due to wanting them available on Linux, but also because iCloud
has been flaky lately. I'm always surprised how well [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] works, and how
easy it is to install. Previously, I'd configured it once and it ran and ran and
I'd forget it was there. You know, like Dropbox used to. So far, this time it
was even easier to set up and has been running without issue.

I'm thinking I'll reserve using [[https://jack.micro.blog][my micro.blog]] for posting images. Mostly.

Pretty happy with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]]. Every day I get closer to calling it and living there for my notes.

Alice and I went for our walk at 3:15 am. It's getting ridiculous. I went back to bed when we got home and now it's 6:00 am and that feels much more reasonable. I've been running on five hours sleep a night for a while now and I don't think it's good for me. I'm not 20 years old.

A week or so ago I removed the analytics (Plausible.io) script from this site and, to my amazement, I don't miss it. I didn't expect that. I've never been obsessed with site views/stats. Curious, but not obsessed. Now I'm not even that curious. However, I do like to keep an eye on overall traffic and things like 404s, so I've re-installed [[https://goaccess.io/][GoAccess]] on the server so I can pop in as needed and review. GoAccess processes the server logs directly, so no need for embedded/tracking scripts.

Against my better judgement, I spent the first half of yesterday continuing to try [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith Linux]]. Honestly, on the big monitor, with a decent mouse and keyboard, I could see a path to Linux full-time when it comes to general computing. This hit home after I'd switched back to my MacBook Pro and after a few minutes thought, "Well, this kind of sucks." I was referring to window management on macOS, and the fact that there isn't any. It's all manual and I noticed that I spend a lot of time micro-manging windows. I immediately missed the Workspaces and i3 setup in Regolith. Didn't expect that! I started to feel that after a couple more days, I would be able to have windows placed right where I want them, but without actually needing to /put/ them there. That would be cool.

And on Linux I have my beloved Emacs and a decent web browser. I have a nice terminal. I have competent file management. I have /control/.

What I don't have is a good way to handle photos. Photo management and editing on Linux is where things start to fall apart. The tools are better than I remember, but they're no match for Capture One, Photo Mechanic, Lightroom, Photoshop, etc. It's not even close, really. I like Darktable and Shotwell and Rawtherapee well enough, and they get the job done, but they're still too janky to live with all the time. In fact, I feel that way about much of Linux; it gets the job done, but there are a lot of rough edges that take the joy out of it. But just imagine if I could sand those smooth.

I woke this morning unable to stop thinking about all this-wondering. I'm writing this while sitting at the ThinkPad plugged into the big screen and learning and swearing, but feeling pretty good. This is currently classified as an "experiment".

Spending half my day yesterday installing [[https://regolith-linux.org][Regolith Linux]] on an old ThinkPad was fun, but useless. I should stop wasting my time like that.

For a time, I thought I'd stick with my Mac on the desktop and use Linux for my portable workstation. Linux is fun to tinker with. There are dozens of variations try. It's got the right philosophy about how things should work and how computing should /be/. I like having it around, but I don't like /using/ it so much.

For years I've used a desktop Mac and a MacBook. Weary of dealing with maintaining two machines and worrying about sync, configuration, etc., I recently consolidated my computers down to one Mac. It's so much better having only one machine. I now realize just how much time I'd spent managing everything. It was /a lot/. Moving to a single-computer setup has been the most productive and satisfying change I've made in years.

And yet there I was, installing Regolith because Paul Ford mentioned it on Twitter.

#+begin_export html
<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Paul Ford on Twitter" data-author="" cite="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1483437985798541316">
I know no one cares but Regolith on Ubuntu + nord theme is a nice way to do a tiling window manager without plowing through a pile of Arch wiki pages where no one will tell you the default modifier key because you should set that yourself.
<footer><cite> <a href="https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1483437985798541316">https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1483437985798541316</a></cite></footer>

#+end_export

That's all it took. I thought, "Hey, that looks neat, I should throw it on the old ThinkPad!" So I did. And Paul was right. It was nice.

I'm infatuated with tiling window managers, and Regolith takes a neat approach to merging [[https://i3wm.org][i3]] and "regular" Ubuntu. I plugged it into my 32" monitor, where a window manager shines. I thought, "I could learn to live like this."

But, after a few hours, all of the little inconsistencies begin to show. I start to miss the little quality-of-life touches that I take for granted on macOS. I once again need to concern myself with sync. And oh, the new MacBook Pro M1 Pro Max is a glorious piece of hardware (and software). Unmatched, as far as I know.

One day I may go all-in on Linux. That's the only way it could work for me. That day is not today, so I need to stop spending too much time thinking it might be.

I don't understand the need for "writing prompts". Unless writing is your job, or you're working on a book, if you don't feel like writing, maybe just don't write and stop worrying about it?

Paul Ford's "scratchy mouth feel" describes how I feel about a lot of things:

I've been thinking about killing Roon and moving to Apple Music. But I have a lifetime license to Roon, so that's weird. The trouble is that Roon doesn't work for me unless it's also connected to Qobuz, which costs me $15/month.

Currently, I pay for Qobuz, Spotify, and Apple Music. That's nuts. Qobuz is fine, but it's no longer the only decent Hi-Res option in town. I've never liked Spotify, but I have family that lives there. I have an Apple One family account, so I'm already paying for everyone to have Music.

Apple Music is not a great app and it's not the smartest streaming service, but I get it with the rest of the Apple One subscription, so that's where I'm headed.

I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and wean everyone from Spotify. And I'm going to have to wean myself from the wonders of Roon, for streaming, at least. Roon still works great with my local music library.

So, I'm not actually leaving Roon. I'm leaving Qobuz, but the effect will be similar.

What do I get in return for all the time and thought I put into taking notes? I
mean, I put a /lot/ of thought into it. What's in it for me? For example, I've been
meticulously recording my meals since December. I can tell you how many times I
ate fast food or had pancakes for breakfast. Big whoop! There is almost zero
lingering value in doing it other than that it's neat. Is "neat" enough to
justify the effort it took to set up the logging process and the ongoing effort
of recording every meal? It's fun to set up, but if I'm honest, it's not useful.
I don't need more excuses to play with my note-taking tools. I should stop
doing it.
