I've been doing this thing where I'm using Evernote again. I know, right? It's almost as if I'm trying to annoy everyone with my retro, proprietary, user-hostile note-taking app. Almost.

There's yet another [[https://micro.blog/jeannie/15790340][thread about Likes on Micro.blog]]. Here's me, in 2017:

@@html:
{{< blockquote author="Jack Baty" link="https://archive.baty.net/2017/likes-on-social-networks-should-be-private/" >}}
Opinion: Likes should be visible to only the Like-or and the Like-ee. Liking something is a simple, unobtrusive way to let someone know I appreciate what they wrote. Itâ€™s also a way to get a little bump when someone likes what I wrote. No one else need be involved.
{{< /blockquote >}}

My opinion on that hasn't changed. Micro.blog should have Likes, but keep them private.

Hello? I don't know what's happening, but after spending too much time yesterday figuring out some export codes in my Tinderbox-driven blog, I started wondering if it makes sense to focus on fewer tools. I'm comfortable in Emacs and I'm reasonably comfortable with Hugo. Should I spend my time getting better at those and /not/ learning more of the intracacies of Tinderbox's export system?

Imagine my surprise when I noticed that the Jane theme used here includes fancy blockquote shortcodes that do exactly what I was trying to do manually via markup and fancy CSS.
