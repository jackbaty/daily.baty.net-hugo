I created this site as a place to capture the things I’m thinking about throughout each day.

There isn’t a specific topic, or trend, or brand, or goal here. It can be pretty mundane.

💌 Reach out via **email**: [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net)

My primary **blog** is at [baty.net](https://baty.net) <br />
The **wiki** is at [wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net)

**Do not expect consistency**.
