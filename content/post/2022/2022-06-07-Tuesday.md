🌦   Light rain, mist +63°F

I bought a <mark>reef tank</mark> this week. I've always admired salt-water aquariums and wondered what it would be like to keep one. I'm about to find out. I'm already learning that I have a shit-ton to learn. One of those things is patience.

Publicly <mark>posting every passing thought</mark> is unnecessary and uncalled for, but I can't seem to stop. At least I'm not spamming everyone's Twitter feed with them.
