I'm having second thoughts about writing my daily posts over on [baty.net](https://baty.net). They don't belong in the RSS feed. Or at least I don't like them there. So, I thought I'd go back to putting them on [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org), but I'm not sure why. Maybe because it's so easy to post there. Perhaps they belong here. After all, it's called "Jack Baty Daily" right? Let's see how it feels.
