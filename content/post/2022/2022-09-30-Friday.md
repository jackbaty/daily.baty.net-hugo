I'm having second thoughts about writing my daily posts over on [baty.net](https://baty.net). They don't belong in the RSS feed. Or at least I don't like them there. So, I thought I'd go back to putting them on [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org), but I'm not sure why. Maybe because it's so easy to post there. Perhaps they belong here. After all, it's called "Jack Baty Daily" right? Let's see how it feels.

I love this piece from Will Rees.

> But here is the strangest, and possibly the saddest, thing about my long and so far unsuccessful attempts to keep a diary: although I can say with complete certainty that I have never disposed of a notebook, as I write this today, on August 27, 2022, with my current, slightly torn black notebook on the table beside me, I have absolutely no idea where its predecessors have got to, nor what they contained, and when I turn my mind to this, as I repeatedly do, the feeling of loss is immeasurable.
