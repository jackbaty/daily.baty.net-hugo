Well, it's October now, I guess. Each new month begins with promise and another empty page. I get to <mark>choose how to fill the pages</mark>. Recently, it feels like too many of them remain empty. I need to fix that.

The <mark>Paper vs Digital debate</mark> continues apace. One nice thing about notes on paper is that I'm not tempted, nor do I feel obligated, to share them. On the other hand, what if I _do_ want to share them?

[Scrintal](https://www.scrintal.com/) opened up their waitlist for anyone willing to pay an introductory annual subscription fee, so I jumped on it. Then after 10 minutes I realized I have no need for yet another note-taking app so I wrote them asking for a refund. It looks like a fine tool, but I need to pass.
