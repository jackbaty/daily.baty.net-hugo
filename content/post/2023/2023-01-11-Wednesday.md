There's yet another [thread about Likes on Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/jeannie/15790340). Here's me, in 2017:


{{< blockquote author="Jack Baty" link="https://archive.baty.net/2017/likes-on-social-networks-should-be-private/" >}}
Opinion: Likes should be visible to only the Like-or and the Like-ee. Liking something is a simple, unobtrusive way to let someone know I appreciate what they wrote. Itâ€™s also a way to get a little bump when someone likes what I wrote. No one else need be involved.
{{< /blockquote >}}

My opinion on that hasn't changed. Micro.blog should have Likes, but keep them private.
