Hello? I don't know what's happening, but after spending too much time yesterday figuring out some export codes in my Tinderbox-driven blog, I started wondering if it makes sense to focus on fewer tools. I'm comfortable in Emacs and I'm reasonably comfortable with Hugo. Should I spend my time getting better at those and _not_ learning more of the intracacies of Tinderbox's export system?

Imagine my surprise when I noticed that the Jane theme used here includes fancy blockquote shortcodes that do exactly what I was trying to do manually via markup and fancy CSS.
