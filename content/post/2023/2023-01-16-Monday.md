I've been doing this thing where I'm using Evernote again. I know, right? It's almost as if I'm trying to annoy everyone with my retro, proprietary, user-hostile note-taking app. Almost.

When I'm on my laptop I prefer keyboard over trackpad. This makes me lean toward using Emacs. Then when I'm docked and using the big screen and mouse, I tend to prefer the more pointy-clicky apps (e.g. Tinderbox, etc.).

Looks like I'm still posting in more places than necessary. I can't seem to help it.

Tana is like doing data entry and Obsidian is a nightmare of workflow/plugins and tweaking.
